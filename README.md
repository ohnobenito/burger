## Installation 
Application is deployed [here](https://intense-badlands-60640.herokuapp.com/) so no installation needed for use. However, if user wants access on local device the user will need to fork the repository and run an npm install by entering in the following on the command line in the correct directory:
`npm install`
This will install all required dependancies into the package.json file that are require to use this application. The user will also need to enter their own mysql requirements to connect to the sql database.

## Usage 
A very easy-to-use application! User can enter a burger name via the text field in the center of the page and click the "Add Burger to Menu" button. This will add the burger to the menu. The user can then click the "Devoure It!" button to add the burger to the display of devoured items.
